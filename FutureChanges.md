# Future Changes
(as of 12.31.20)

Although I condisder this project finished, no project is never truly done. Here are a few things I might add to it later...

- any TODO mentioned in the code
- add menu to the start of the game
- change the color scheme of the gui to make it look prettier
- add Junit tests
- add networking so people can play world wide
